### Notes:
1. `Max tracks possible = capacity/(width+spacing)`

2. Each layer may have a unique capacity in each direction per global routing tile, and it may be different for horizontal and vertical directions. Preferred routing directions will be given by having a zero capacity in the non-preferred direction. In the vertical and horizontal capacity lines, the first number indicates the capacity on the first layer, the second number the second layer, and so on. Minimum wire widths and minimum wire spacings are also specified; this impacts capacity calculations as shown in the earlier note.

3. The lower left corner (minimum X and Y) of the global routing region is specified, as well as the width (X dimension) and height (Y dimension) of each tile.

4. Additionally, pin positions are given in terms of absolute length, rather than tile/grid coordinates. Conversion from pin positions to tile numbers can be done with `floor(pin_x - lower_left_x)/tile_width` and `floor (pin_y - lower_left_y)/tile_height`. Pins will not be on the borders of global routing cells, so there should be no ambiguity. All pins will be within the specified global routing region.

5. Each net will have a minimum routed width; this width will span all layers. When routing, compute the utilization of a global routing graph edge by adding the widths of all nets crossing and edge, plus the minimum spacing multiplied by the number of nets. Each wire will require spacing between it's neighbors; think of this as having one-half of the minimum spacing reserved on each side of a wire.

6. Congestion is modeled by including capacity adjustments. In the global routing benchmarks, there may be obstacles, or pre-routed wires. To communicate this to the global router, pairs of (adjacent) global routing tiles may have a capacity that is different from the default values specified at the start of a benchmark file.

7. Calculation of capacity is more complex than is done in typical academic global routing tools. Each global routing tile will have a capacity; this is a measure of the available space, not the number of global routing tracks. If the minimum wire width is 20, the minimum spacing 10, and the capacity of a tile is given as 450, this corresponds to 15 minimum width tracks (15 * (20 + 10)) . Therefore, capacity here will have the dimensions of length. The capacity specified as the default value may be different than the width or height of a tile. In general, it is desirable to have routing utilization of a tile be below the capacity, as higher utilization can be more difficult for detail routers to complete.
